# algorithms 01

taken from FrontEndMasters course at: https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/unique-sort-exercise/

## branch 1

Here we are just adding a plain sort method for a simple array of numbers

## branch 2

here we are creating an actual dataset and sorting by a numerical value on that dataset by using a number property [age]. sorting by numbers is pretty easy.

## branch 3

now we are going to adapt our sorting algorithm to handle sorting by strings

## branch 4

now lets add some date sorting to our algorithm

## branch 5

Now we need to take into consideration seperation of concerns. We should really seperate out the unique functionality and the sort functionality. These should really be two seperate things.
